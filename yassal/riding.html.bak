          form of horse riding seen throughout the world. The term is misleading
          because many equestrian countries like Germany, France, Italy or Spain
          have used the same style of riding, with variations, for centuries.
          There are many variations, but all feature a flat English saddle
          without the deep seat, high cantle or saddle horn seen on a Western
          saddle nor the knee pads seen on an Australian Stock Saddle.</p>

          considered a style of horse riding which has evolved from the ranching
          and welfare traditions which were bought to the Americans by the
          Spanish Conquistadors, as well as both equipment and riding style
          which evolved to meet the working needs of the cowboy in the American
          West. At the time, American cowboys had to work long hours in the
          saddle and often over rough terrain, sometimes having to rope a cattle
          using a lariat, also known as a lasso.</p>

          term, most commonly translated to mean "training") is a highly skilled
          form of riding performed in exhibition and competition, as well as an
          "art" sometimes pursued solely for the sake of mastery. As an
          equestrian sport defined by the International Equestrian Federation,
          dressage is described as "the highest expression of horse training"
          where "horse and rider are expected to perform from memory a series of
          predetermined movements.</p>

          fun, but it also can be quite a challenge. For the beginner, it's
          probably best to leave starting young horses to more experienced
          trainers. Youngsters are too unpredictable, and knowledge, timing, and
          skill are required for success. But really, we train our horses—even
          extensively trained ones, each time we interact with them. When you
          teach your horse something new, it means you've learned something as
          well, and that is very rewarding. .</p>

          equestrian performance sport, typically involving two or more horses
          ridden by jockeys (or sometimes driven without riders) over a set
          distance, for competition. It is one of the most ancient of all
          sports, as its basic premise – to identify which of two or more horses
          is the fastest over a set course or distance – has been unchanged
          since at least classical antiquity.[1] This sport is also very
          dangerous, with 700 to 800 horse deaths per year- an estimated amount
          of two breakdowns out of 1000.</p>

          their ponies, and not just ‘ride them’, greatly boosts their
          confidence and learning. Kids as young as six easily learn and
          understand the basic principles of horse training, such as
          pressure-release, rewards, timing and one signal for one response.
          In this exclusive series, Manuela McLean co-founder of Equitation
          Science International, explains some of the techniques developed by
          herself and Dr Andrew McLean to help children learn about training
          and, at the same time, teach them to re-train and correct some of the
          common problem behaviours that many ponies learn.</p>
